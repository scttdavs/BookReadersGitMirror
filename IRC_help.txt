How to join cs 427 BookReaders IRC channel!

Step 1: Registering yourself on FreeNode
It's up to you to get an IRC client but I recommend LimeChat, HexChat, or XChat depending on your OS (OSX, Windos, and Linux respectively)
Once you do that you need to create & lock in a nickname. Please make this your netID. Do this by typing the following commands (replacing the commands between asterisks with your options *NETID* -> netID)

/nick *NETID*
/msg NickServ REGISTER *PASSWORD* *EMAIL*

At this point you will have to go to your email and enter the command found there to register your email with the nickname serv. After doing that you need to change some settings:

/msg NickServ SET ENFORCE ON

To log in later you need to just type in:

/msg NickServ IDENTIFY *NETID* *PASSWORD*

After this you're going to want to message me that you have successfully created your nick. If I set up the authentication correctly you should just be able to type in:

/join ##427BookReaders

I added everyone's netIDs already so everything should be good to go! If you want admin privelages let me know.
